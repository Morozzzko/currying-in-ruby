# Curry

My attempt at writing my own currying in Ruby

Currently it provides 2 ways of currying. I'm not sure about terminology so please write me an email with a better name.

Two ways of currying:

* Plain, simple, and slow. Generates a new lambda until you can apply the function
* Right-folded. Relatively threadsafe (not tested), a bit more performant

I'll write benchmarks for that and check it out
